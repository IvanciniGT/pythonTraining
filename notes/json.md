JSON comes from JavaScript Object Notation.

JavaScript... another programming language.
In Javascript we have DATA... same as in Python.
We have variables, functions, classes, etc.

In js we define a variable by using the keyword "var".

```javascript
var name = "John";
```

```python
name = "John"
```

"John" is just DATA ( a string <--- DATATYPE )
3 is just DATA ( an integer <--- DATATYPE )
True is just DATA ( a boolean <--- DATATYPE )

The way we represent DATA in Javascript is called JSON.

Usually, when we see a JSON file we see something like this:

```json
{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "married": true,
}
```

Over there we have a DICTIONARY in Javascript.

```json
[
    {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30,
        "married": true,
    },
    {
        "name": "Jane",
        "age": 25,
        "married": false,
    },
    {
        "name": "Jack",
        "age": 40,
        "married": true,
    }
]

```
