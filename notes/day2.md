There is a sentence that I would tattoo to every single person doing a program.
Probably in their hands... so they can see it every single time they type a line of code.

> Software is by definition, both a maintainable and an evolving product.

Imagine that you buy a car. 
One year after that you know (actually you that in advance, before getting the car) that you will need to change the oil.
And you take your car to the mechanic, and you say... It's 9am... 14pm is ok?
An the imagine if the mechanic says... 
Are you kidding me? To change the oil is an extremely complex task... I need to disassemble the engine, and then I need to reassemble it.
So.. maybe you should come in a month... And for sure... it will cost about 8,000$


It's not only about the car working properly... a car, by definition, is a product that will need maintenance.
