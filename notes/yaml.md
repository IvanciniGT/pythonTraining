# YAML

JSON is a subset of YAML.

YAML spec (nowadays in version 2.1) is a superset of JSON. It contains all the features of JSON and extends it with a huge amount of additional fancy features.

We love YAML.

5 programs that make use of yaml?
- Docker (containers)
- Kubernetes
- Azure DevOps / Gitlab CI/CD
- Ansible
- Helm (Kubernetes package manager)
- Ubuntu network manager
- Notepad

Sadly... the is no official YAML module in Python     :(

For that reason, we need to install a third-party module called "PyYAML".

We have to install that module.
That is a third party module.

We have thousands of third party modules right now.

How do we install a third party module?

```bash
# It used to be like this
pip install pyyaml
```

Nowadays
```bash
python -m pip install pyyaml
```
