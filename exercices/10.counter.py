import time # We are importing the time module
            # that module defines a function called sleep
            # that function will allow us to pause the execution of the program for a while

            # But the truth is that a program does not execute itself.
            # Threads execute programs.
            # What the pause function actually does is to tell the thread that is 
            # executing the program to stop executing the program for a while.

# The definition of what a "thread" is in python is in CLASS called Thread...
# But that program is defined in a module called threading
import threading
# Someone who can count

              # Here we say to python... A Counter is a Thread... with a custom behavior
class Counter(threading.Thread):
    # If a counter is a Thread... it will inherit all the attributes and methods of the Thread class
    # as defined in the threading module
    # We can also define new attributes and methods for the Counter class

    # The Thread class of python threading module has a method called start().
    # That method allows us to start the execution of the thread.... to start its life cycle....
    # Completely independent from the main thread of the program.

    # In python, as defined in the Thread class of the threading module, 
    # the start method will call internally a method called "run"... that should be defined in the Thread class.
    # The code inside the run method is the code that will be executed by the thread.... in parallel with the main thread.

    # From the main thread we will call the "start" method of the thread object.
    # And internally, python creates a new OS THREAD... that will execute the code defined in the run method.

    # Actually the Thread class already has a run method defined... but that implementation is empty.
    # We can override that method with our own implementation: THE TASK that we want the new thread to execute.


    # The constructor of the class
    def __init__(self, name, max_value, delay):
        # whenever a class extends another class... It is mandatory to call the constructor of the parent class
        super().__init__()
        self.name = name
        self.max_value = max_value
        self.delay = delay

        self.start()
    
    def run(self): # This overrides the default implementation of the run method in the Thread class
        for number in range(1, self.max_value + 1):
            print("I am counter " + self.name + " and I am counting " + str(number))
            # After counting one number, we want to chill for a while (that delay)
            # Python already has a function for that... similar to the sleep command in linux.
            time.sleep(self.delay)
            # The sleep function is defined in the `time` module
            # In order to use it, we have to import the module first

# Question 1: Who will execute this line of code? MAIN_THREAD
# Question 2: When this line of code will get executed? (When the HI message will shop up?)
# This line will get executed when the main thread reaches this line of code.... 
# And the main thread is wait for the other threads to finish their work?? NO
print("HI")
# Maybe we could wait for some of them...
my_first_counter.join() ## This makes the main thread to wait for the first counter to finish (actually for the run method of the first counter to finish)
                         #Â Thats how we synchronize threads
print("First counter is done")
my_second_counter.join() ## This makes the main thread to wait for the first counter to finish (actually for the run method of the first counter to finish)
print("Second counter is done") 
my_third_counter.join() ## This makes the main thread to wait for the first counter to finish (actually for the run method of the first counter to finish)

# The join function is defined in the Thread class of the threading module
# Our Counters inherit that function from the Thread class


# NOW We could make a program (SCRIPT) that checks the status of our services ...
# Not one by one... but in parallel
# Ey .. maybe I have 200 services.. and I want to check them 5 by 5
# I can create 5 threads... each one checking 1 service at a time
# And split the work between them... I will give 200/5 = 40 services to each thread

# That means, my program will finish in 1/5 of the time that it would take to check all the services one by one
